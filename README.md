# üß© Order Processing System

This project contains a set of microservices designed to simulate a simple order processing system. The services
include:

- `order-service`
- `payment-service`
- `inventory-service`
- `notification-service`

It also includes a Cassandra database used for storing order history data.

---

## üê≥ Running the Microservices with Docker Compose

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Java 17
- Maven
- Docker Desktop (with WSL 2 integration enabled)
- Git Bash or any terminal that supports Bash scripting

---

### 2. Accessing the Project Root (WSL/Git Bash on Windows)

To navigate to your project directory from WSL or Git Bash:

```bash
cd /mnt/c/T-Projects/order-processing-system
```

### 3. Building the Services

Before running the services, you need to build each one using Maven.

Use the provided script:

```bash
./run_services.sh
```

üõ† This will run `mvn clean package -DskipTests` for each service under the `C:/T-Projects/order-processing-system`
directory.

### 4. Running the Containers
To start all services and dependencies defined in your docker-compose.yml:

üí° Use `docker-compose logs -f` to follow logs and verify everything is running.

### 5. Starting Cassandra

Run the script below to start the Cassandra container and initialize the keyspace and table:

```bash
./start_and_init_cassandra.sh
```

This script does the following:

* Starts Cassandra using Docker Compose
* Waits until Cassandra is healthy
* Creates the `orders_keyspace keyspace`

### 6. Running Cassandra database

#### 6.1. Starting Cassandra container with Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up -d cassandra
```

#### 6.2. Initializing Cassandra

```bash
docker exec -it cassandra cqlsh
```

#### 6.3. Applying schema

```csl

CREATE KEYSPACE IF NOT EXISTS orders_keyspace
WITH replication = {
  'class': 'SimpleStrategy',
  'replication_factor': 1
};

USE orders_keyspace;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS order_history (
  orderid bigint PRIMARY KEY,
  customername text,
  product text,
  quantity int,
  paymentstatus text
);

USE orders_keyspace;

SELECT * FROM order_history;
```
